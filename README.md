Rutgers Boot Camp Module 1 Submittion by Leonid Lyakhovich

Work by Leonid Lyakhovich following the direction of Module 1 Assignment.

Read "Microsoft Support" Articals on two functions:
  1. TEXTBEFORE (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/textbefore-function-d099c28a-dba8-448e-ac6c-f086d0fa1b29)
  2. TEXTAFTER (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/textafter-function-c8db2546-5b51-416a-9690-c7e6722e90b4)

Other Functions were used prior to Course and no reading of function documentation was needed.

Personal Note: Average Donation is hard to gage when working in different currencies, in order to gain any insite I would suggest to convert to a single currency like the US Dollar.

Support Staff Contacted : None
